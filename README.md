# Imixs-Workflow IoT

The Imixs-Workflow IoT project provides a set of connectors and services to process data generated by IoT devices with the Imixs-Workflow platform. With the provided adapter classes data produced by a micro controller like [Ardoino](https://www.arduino.cc/) can be easily processed just by describing a worklfow in a BPMN 2.0 model.
In this way it is for example possible to react on senor data like  temperature, humidity, movement, acceleration and any other things provided by a IoT device, and start some kind of human centric workflow. This includes monitoring, alerting or control IoT devices.

Imixs-Worklfow IoT provides a set of adapter classes to connect a IoT device to the Imixs Workflow engine without the need for in-depth knowledge in micro controller programming. 
For example, reaching a certain temperature range can directly trigger an alarm from a technician. 

Imixs-Worklfow IoT includes a Web Server with a modern Web interface to monitor connected IoT devices and react on certain events. 


## Sensor Data

In the following basic szenario the Ardoino controller is connected directly to two external sensors.

The data can be controlled by Imixs-IoT based on a BPMN 2.0 model definition. 


## Inter Controller Communication

In a more complex situation you can also connect an existing microcontroler to the Ardoino Contrller. In this case you need to re-map the GPIO and connect the Ardoino controller.
