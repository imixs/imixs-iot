# Imixs-Workflow IoT

Imixs-Workflow IoT project provides a workflow service connecting IoT devices and handle external data like temperature, humidity, movement, acceleration and any other things provided by a IoT device

Imixs-Worklfow IoT is based on the Imixs-Workflow engine to react on situations which you are interested in. This can be a high temperature or any kind of unexpected data. Based on BPMN 2.0 model you define what should hapen next. Usually this is a human interaction - for example restarting a machine or adjusting some parameters. 

This all can be monitored by a Web interface. Using BPMN business rules you can define fine graned logic to detect the data you are interested in. As Imixs-Workflow is open source you can connect the project also to any other Imixs Workflow technolgy. For example you can use the Imixs-ML technolgoy to analyse your data by a Machine Learning plattform.
